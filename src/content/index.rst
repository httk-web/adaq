ADAQ
====

ADAQ is a collection of automatic workflows used for high-throughput calculations of point defects in semiconductors. These workflows are implemented using *httk*. ADAQ automates every step in the theoretical process of calculating defects: it relaxes the unit cell, creates the defect supercells with arbitrarily sized defect clusters, screens these defects for the most relevant properties, and can fully characterize a point defect. The full characterization workflow calculates magneto-optical properties, such as zero phonon lines (ZPL), zero field splitting (ZFS), and hyperfine coupling parameters for many different charge and spin states for the defects.
